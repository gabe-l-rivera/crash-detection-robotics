# ultrasonic-sensor
*In progress of uplaoding:* The following collection of files represents the development of an ultrasonic range-finding sensor, interfaced to a Tiva TM4C-123 microcontroller. This range-finding technology was implememnted for a crash-detection robotics project in my embedded systems course at the University of Kentucky. These files are written in embedded C and ARM assembly.
